<p>There's a coincidence today.</p> 
<p>On this day 390 years ago, the great explorer Sir Francis Drake died aboard ship off the coast of Panama.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In his lifetime the great frontiers were the oceans, and a historian later said,“He lived by the sea, died on it, and was buried in it.”&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Well, today, we can say of the Challenger crew: Their dedication was, like Drake's, complete.</p>
